# NLP Assignments – UChicago Applied Data Science

## Overview
This repository contains selected NLP course assignments completed at the University of Chicago as part of the Applied Data Science program. These projects demonstrate practical applications of machine learning and deep learning models on text data, including topic modeling, transformer-based classification, and interpretability techniques.

## Project Summaries

### Topic Modeling on Financial Complaints

- Used LDA and BERTopic to uncover latent topics in customer complaint narratives.
- Cleaned and preprocessed large volumes of unstructured text using regex, stopword filtering, and tokenization.
- Visualized topic clusters and analyzed interpretability.

### Patent Classification using Transformers

- Used Hugging Face models to classify patent abstracts into technology categories.
- Compared two approaches: text truncation vs. segment-based modeling.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy and F1-score.
